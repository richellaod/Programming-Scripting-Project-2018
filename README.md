# Programming- and-Scripting-Project-2018
Project for Programming and Scripting Module 2018 by Richella O'Driscoll


## Problem Statement

This project concerns the well known Fishers Iris Data Set. The project entails you to research the data set and then write documentation and code in the Python Programming Language based on your research.
An online search for information on the data set will convince you that many people have investigated and written about it previously, many of those are not experienced programmers. You are expected to break the project into several smaller tasks that are easier to solve and to plug these together after they have been completed. You might do that for this project as follows:

1. Research background information about the data set and write a summary about it.
2. Keep a list of references you used in completing the project.
3. Download the data set and write some Python code to investigate it.
4. Summarise the data set by calculating the maximum, minimum and mean of each column of the data set. 
5. Write a summary of your investigations.
6. Include supporting tables and graphics that you deem to be neccasary.

## The Iris Data Set

The Iris flower data set or Fisher's Iris data set is a multivariate data set which was introduced by the British statistician and biologist Ronald Fisher, in his 1936 paper “The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems as an example of linear discriminant analysis”. It can also be referred to as Anderson's Iris data set because Edgar Anderson collected the data to quantify the morphologic variation of Iris flowers of three related species.


This data set consists of 50 samples from each of three species of Iris (Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor). Four features were measured from each sample: the length of the sepals and the width of the sepals, and the length of the petals and the width of the petals in centimetres. Based on the combination of these four features, Fisher went on to develop a linear discriminant model which would distinguish the species from each other. The data is provided in CSV format and this is seen below:
