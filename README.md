# Programming-Scripting-Project-2018
Project for Programming ann Scripting Module 2018 by Richella O'Driscoll


## Problem Statement

This project concerns the well known Fishers Iris Data Set. The project entails you to research the data set and then write documentation and code in teh Python Programming Language based on your research.
An online search for information on the data set will convince you that many people have investigated and written about it previously, many of those are not experienced programmers. You are expected to break the project into several smaller tasks that are easier to solve and to plug these together after they have been completed. You might do that for this project as follows:

1. Research background information about the data set and write a summary about it.
2. Keep a list of references you used in completing the project.
3. Download the data set and write some Python code to investigate it.
4. Summarise the data set by calculating the maximum, minimum and mean of each column of the data set. 
5. Write a summary of your investigations.
6. Include supporting tables and graphics that you deem to be neccasary.
